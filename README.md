# JIMWLK

JIWMLK evolution in Julia with the goal of writing rc-parent-dipole JIMWLK on CUDA. 


## Initial conditions on the field of Wilson lines

* Consider a Gaussian field $\rho$ with the variance (in lattice unites already) 

$$ \langle \rho^a(\vec{x} = a\vec{i}_x) \rho^b(\vec{y} =a \vec{i}_y) \rangle = \frac{1}{N_y a^2} \mu^2 \delta^{ab} \delta_{\vec{i}_x, \vec{i}_y} $$
